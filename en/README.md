# Preface

The Rcpp package enables you to write R functions in C++. Rcpp is implemented carefully so that you can write your Rcpp code in the way similar to R without sacrificing execution speed. Thus, even people who do not have deep C++ knowledge can enjoy its high performance outcomes.

This document is intended to provide necessary information for people who are not familiar with C++. Thus we would sometimes explain conceptualally rather than describing detailed C++ definition preciselly.

This document is preliminary version, so any comments or suggestions are welcome. Thank you. Then, let's get into the World of Rcpp!
