# Preface

The Rcpp package enables you to write R functions in C++. Rcpp is implemented carefully so that you can write your Rcpp code in the way similar to R. For example, you can find the data types and functions that are almost identical to R. Furthermore, the execution speed is not sacrificed for the easy usage, thus the even people without deep C++ knowledge can enjoy its high performance outcomes.

This document is intended to provide necessary information for people not being familiar with C++ as easy as possible. Thus we would sometimes explain conceptualally rather than describing detailed C++ definition preciselly.

This document is preliminary version, so any comments or suggestions are welcome. Thank you. Then, let's get into the World of Rcpp!
