# Preface

Rcpp is a package that enables you to implement R functions in C++. It is implemented so as to write your C++ code in a style similar to R, so it is easy to use even without deep knowledge of C++. And because Rcpp does not sacrifice execution speed for the ease of use, anyone can get high performance results.

This document is preliminary version, so I would greatly appreciate it if you kindly give me some feedback on this document.
