# Preface

The Rcpp package enables you to write R functions in C++. Rcpp is implemented so as to your Rcpp code looks like R code. Thus you can find the data types and functions have almost identical to those of R. The execution speed is not sacrificed for the ease of usage, thus the even people without deep C++ knowledge can enjoy its high performance.

This document is intended to provide necessary information for people not being familiar with C++ as easy as possible. Thus we would sometimes explain conceptualally rather than describing detailed C++ definition preciselly.

This document is preliminary version, so any comments or suggestions are welcome. Thank you. Then, let's get into the World of Rcpp!



 Rcpp is implemented carefully in order that your
