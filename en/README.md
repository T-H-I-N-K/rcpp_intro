# Preface

The Rcpp package enables you to write R functions in C++. Rcpp is carefully implemented in order that the variables and functions that have almost identical functionalities to those of R language. The execution speed is not sacrificed for the ease of usage, thus the even peaple without deep C++ knowleadge can enjoy its high performance functionalities.

This document is intended to provide neccesary information for people not being familiar with C++ as easy as possible. Thus we would sometimes explain conceptualally rather than describing detailed C++ definition preciselly.

This document is preliminary version, so any comments or suggestions are welcome. Thank you. Then, let's get into the World of Rcpp!
