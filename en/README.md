# Preface

The Rcpp package enables you to write R functions in C++. Rcpp is carefully implemented in order that you can find variables and functions that have almost identical functionalities to those of R language. The execution speed is not sacrificed for the ease of usage, thus the even peaple without deep C++ knowleadge can enjoy its high performance functionalities.

This document is intended to provide neccesary information as easy as possible for people who is not familiar with C++. Thus we sometimes explain C++ conceptualally rather than describing precise C++ language definition.

This document is preliminary version so that any comment or suggestion is welcome.

Then, the introductory remark is over. Let's get into the World of Rcpp!
