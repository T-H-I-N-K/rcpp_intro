# Preface

The Rcpp package enables you to write R functions in C++. By using Rcpp, you can use your C++ function from R. In addition, Rcpp is implemented so as to write your C++ code in the way similar to R without sacrificing execution speed. Thus, even people who do not have deep C++ knowledge can enjoy its high performance outcomes.

This document is preliminary version, so I would greatly appreciate it if you kindly give me some feedback on this document.
